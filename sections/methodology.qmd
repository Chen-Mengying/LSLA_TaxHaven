-   ***Data sources:** Land Matrix (deals), ORBIS (ownership structures), and a custom tax haven list (20 countries).*
-   ***Sample:** Deals currently `in operation.`*
-   ***Matching method:** Flag investors as `is_tax_haven = TRUE/FALSE` using ISO codes.*
-   ***Analytical framework:***
    -   *Distribution analysis (scale, time, and sectoral trends)*
    -   *Network analysis (connectivity and centrality)*
    -   *Role analysis (position in ownership chains)*
    -   *Impact analysis (social and environmental risks)*

## Data Preparation

-   Select only “in operation” deals using `current_implementation_status`.

<!-- -->

-   Match investor registration countries against tax haven lists (e.g., Tax Haven Index
-   Create a binary variable `is_tax_haven = TRUE/FALSE`.

### Planned Outputs

-   Summary table of dataset size (deals, investors, tax haven share).
-   Count of unique investors and target countries.
